# hello-world-chip8
This will be emulator for chip8 architecture.
currently I'm testing on it mainly TETRIS.
The game is runnig but the control is uncomfortable.

my next targets are:
1) Now that I know how to use all the required things, I can rewrite parts of the code to make the code more flexiable and more
   robust.
2) I need to make the control more easy.
