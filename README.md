# chip8curses

keybinding:
	q:	Quit the emulator.
	ENTER:	Pause / Resume game.
	<F5>: 	At pause mode, step one instruction.
	2,3,4,5,
	w,e,r,t,
	s,d,f,g,
	x,c,v,b:	the keyboard of the chip-80.
	<F6>: Make the emulator slower.
	<F7>: Make the emulator faster. (by default the emulator is running on full speed.)
If the keyboard is not working, please make sure that you are typing lower-case english characters.

Install instruction:
	You can run install.sh. It isn't realy installing anything, it's just compiling the code to the current directory.
Run instruction:
	just type ./chip8curses rom-path



My next targets are:
1) Write a documentation on the code.
2) I have a cool idea for  upgrade for the display.
3) Add cross-platform support.
4) Add support for graphical UI
5) Currently the emulator is only interpreter. It will be fun to make a recompiler.

Feel fun to send to me notes via github.
